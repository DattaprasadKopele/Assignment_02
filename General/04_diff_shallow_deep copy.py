 ''' The main difference between shallow copy and deep copy '''





The main difference between shallow copy and deep copy is that
shallow copy creates a new object and then populates it with references to the child objects found in the original,

while deep copy creates a new object and then recursively populates it
with copies of the child objects found in the original.

Shallow copy is not recursive
Deep copy is recursive

 Shallow copy doesnot create copies of child objects
 Deep copy recursively create copies of child objects
